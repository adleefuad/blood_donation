# Blood Donation Assignment
Assignment for building a data pipeline from extracting data from MoH github and creating a visualisation to Telegram Bot



## Deployment

To use the service:
1. Input Your Telegram Bot Token and Group Chat ID at config.py
2. Change your anaconda directory in run.bat file
3. Create environment using the requirements.txt
```bash
  conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
```
4. To start the service click run.bat

I have compiled my EDA regarding the data (EDA.pynb) and my thought process while exploring and deciding what visualisation to use
