# Blood Donation Assignment
<p>Assignment for building a data pipeline from extracting data from MoH github and creating a visualisation to Telegram Bot</p>
<p></p>Input Your Telegram Bot Token and Group Chat ID at config.py</p>
<p>I have compiled my EDA regarding the data (EDA.pynb) and my thought process while exploring and deciding what visualisation to use</p>
<p>I set the scheduler to start at 4pm everyday as It is usually the time for the MOH announcement for Covid-19 and also to make sure the data has been updated</p>
